# Assignment-6

I learned a lot from this project. This project allows users to input text, analyze word frequencies, and display the top 5 most frequent words in a table format. As building this project, I've strengthened my skills in DOM manipulation, JavaScript string methods, and data handling techniques. The project also includes CSS styling for a visually appealing user interface.
